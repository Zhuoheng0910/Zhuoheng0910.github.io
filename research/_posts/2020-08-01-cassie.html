intro: In this project we developed a controller to make bipedal legged robot Cassie perform agile locomotion skills using Poximal Policy Optimization. <p>Using reference motion generated from optimized BÃ©zier curve of feet trajectories we designed the reward function to make Cassie imitate these motions.</p> <p>We tested the performance of trained RL controller on Simulink and successfully transferred learned skills to real robot. Currently we are working on summarizing our findings into a journal paper.</p>
