intro: In this project we developed a controller to make bipedal legged robot Cassie perform agile locomotion skills using Poximal Policy Optimization. Using reference motion generated from optimized BÃ©zier curve of feet trajectories we designed the reward function of the reinforcement learning structure. We tested the performance of trained RL controller on Simulink and are working on transferring learned skills to real robot.
